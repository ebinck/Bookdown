# Introduction

This is a compilation of the code I have written thus far for my master's research, quantifying wetlands that have been sampled with BLM's Terrestrial Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) program.  While the Terrestrial program aims to sample upland ecosystems, over 40,000 sites have been sampled, meaning even with minimal error, there are likely hundreds of sites that qualify as wetlands.  In this bookdown, I use a number of criteria to identify "wetland" sites in the Terrestrial AIM database. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
